# Role-Based-Authentication-
I build a comprehensive Role-Based User Management Web Application with authentication, user management, and database functionality.

However, since its requirements include backend functionality like:

Authentication system (login, logout, registration, password management)
Database storage for users and roles
User management APIs (create, delete, view users)
Role-based access control with secure permissions
